# Quantum-Inspired Decision-Making Using Lagrangian Mechanics and Wayfinding Principles

## Overview
This project simulates **Stentor roeseli's** behavior using a novel decision-making framework based on **Lagrangian mechanics**, **Wayfinding Theory** and **energy dynamics**, integrating **agentic** and **systemic energy**. The model incorporates environmental feedback, quantum decision-making principles, and adaptive learning to mimic intelligent behaviors in unicellular organisms.

## Lagrangian Mechanics: Agentic and Systemic Energy
Inspired by **Lagrangian mechanics**, the system balances:
- **Agentic Energy**: Cognitive resources for decision-making.
- **Systemic Energy**: Metabolic energy for actions.  
Stentor roeseli optimizes actions by minimizing energy expenditure, ensuring efficient adaptation to environmental changes.

### Energy Dynamics
- **Agentic Energy**: Governs decision-making, depleted with complex actions. A higher agentic energy leads to more exploratory actions.
- **Systemic Energy**: Regulates metabolic functions and determines the viability of physically demanding actions like detachment.

## Wayfinding and Decision-Making
The Stentor's decision-making mimics biological wayfinding principles, evaluating the environment, energy costs, and future risks to navigate a grid-based environment effectively. 

### Key Steps:
1. **Environmental Assessment**: Stentor evaluates current environmental states (e.g., nutrient density, predator presence) using an **environmental score**.
   
2. **Dynamic Prospective Oscillations**: Introduces quantum-like oscillations to adjust decision probabilities based on past actions, energy levels, and environmental factors.

3. **Long-Term Prospection**: Predicts future risks and rewards using environmental trends. The Stentor anticipates future conditions, adjusting its behavior accordingly.
   
4. **Action Costs**: Every action has a **metabolic cost**, and complex decisions reduce agentic energy. For example:
   - **Detachment**: High cost but leads to new opportunities if the current environment is unfavorable.
   - **Bend**: Low cost, used to navigate less threatening environments.

5. **Modify Possibility Space**: Stentor dynamically adjusts the set of possible actions based on its history, current environment, and oscillations in energy levels.

6. **Quantum Decision-Making**: Actions are placed in **quantum superposition** and resolved based on probabilities influenced by energy dynamics, uncertainty, and environmental factors.

### Decision-Making Example
- **Scenario**: Stentor is in a nutrient-poor grid with high predator presence.
- **Energy Levels**:
   - **Agentic Energy**: Moderate, allowing complex decision-making.
   - **Systemic Energy**: Low, pushing Stentor to avoid high-cost actions.
- **Decision**: Based on quantum oscillations, Stentor weighs between **detach** (explore new grid) and **bend** (conserve energy). If future environmental trends show low nutrient improvement, Stentor may **detach** despite high cost.

## Visualization and Environment
The environment is visualized as a **2D grid** where each cell represents environmental factors like nutrient density, predator presence, and toxin levels. The Stentor moves across the grid, evaluating each cell’s **environmental score**.

### Visualization:
- **Color-coded Grids**: Cells are shaded based on environmental score (e.g., red for high risk, green for favorable conditions).
- **Action Representation**: Actions (e.g., **bend**, **detach**) are visually distinct, with bead sizes representing stimulus intensity.

## Key Quantum Functions:
1. **Dynamic Prospective Oscillation**: Introduces variability in decision-making by simulating quantum-like oscillations in agentic energy. These oscillations ensure the Stentor doesn't take a deterministic path but explores various actions depending on its energy and environmental feedback.
   
2. **Quantum Feedback Loop**: Refines the action selection based on real-time environmental feedback, adding adaptability to the decision-making process.

3. **Quantum Path Dependency**: The Stentor’s past actions influence its future possibilities, simulating how habits or decision biases develop over time.

## Conclusion
This model integrates cutting-edge quantum-inspired decision-making principles with energy management dynamics, creating a robust system that mimics real-life adaptive behaviors. The simulation explores how a unicellular organism can intelligently navigate its environment, balancing energy costs, environmental risks, and future rewards.
